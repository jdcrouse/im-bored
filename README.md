# im bored

sometimes i'm bored and i want to hang out with people, but it can be a pain to text a bunch of friends to see who happens to be free. what if i could just let them know at the push of a button and they could react and respond?

i'm just messing around trying to understand ios apps better :)

## Run instructions
### Frontend
From ./app, run `bun install` to install deps, and `bun expo start` to start the app locally with expo.

### Backend
From ./backend, run `go run .` to run the api on localhost:8080

## TODO
- persist anything
- read server config from environment rather than hardcoding localhost:8080
- figure out how an ios app using expo even gets deployed?
- make boredom broadcasts interactive
- etc
